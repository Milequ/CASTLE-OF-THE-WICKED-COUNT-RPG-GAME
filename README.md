Castle of the Wicked Count

A Python text-adventure inspired by classic Zork-style interactive fiction.

Overview

This project is a prototype terminal-based adventure game set inside a ruined medieval castle.
The player explores interconnected rooms, collects items, unlocks doors using keys, and ultimately discovers the ancient crown hidden at the top of the tower.

The game is designed to be simple, readable, and easily expandable for future development.
